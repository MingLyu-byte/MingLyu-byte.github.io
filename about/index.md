## About me
My name is Ming Lyu (吕铭). I prefer the nickname Leo. I was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, China. (The hometown for Xun Lu, who probably is the most famous writter in China). I went to Hangzhou Foreign Languages School for my first year of high school. Then, I went to Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, which is located in Cincinnati, Ohio 
and got my High school diploma there. I graduted from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree with double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in discrete applied math. I am currently a Master Computer Science Student with Specialization in Data Science at University of Southern California.
