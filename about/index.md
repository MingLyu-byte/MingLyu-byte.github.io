## About me
My name is Ming Lyu (吕铭). I prefer the nickname Leo. I was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, China. (The hometown for Xun Lu, who probably is the most famous writer in China). I went to Hangzhou Foreign Languages School for my first year of high school. Then, I went to Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, which is located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and got my High school diploma there. I graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in discrete applied math. I am currently a Master Computer Science Student with a Specialization in Data Science at University of Southern California.
