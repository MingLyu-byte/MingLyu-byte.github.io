I did a entry level research on Blockchain under the supervision of Dr. Nathan Chenette. Here are somethings I researched on over the summer of 2017:
<ul>
<li>Research on cryptocurrency and blockchain technics.</li>
<li>Overview of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA. Analyze Cryptocurrencies from their designs and architectures. (reality vs hype)</li>
<li>Research on how regulation should be applied to Cryptocurrency. (one example is money laundry)</li>
<li>Personal Interest in how blockchain technics will enhance the Internet of Things. (most interested in IOTA's tangle system)</li>
</ul>

Below is the abstract of my report:

IoT - Internet of Things - is one of the next biggest evolutions is history, where human-to-human, human-to-machine, and machine-to-machine communications are all supported. Blockchain, an innovative technology, is the key to solve many problems like deficient architecture raised by IoT network. Although most applications of blockchain are around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology brings the future of IoT in fields like healthcare, finance, transportation and many others to a higher level than the common client-server model due to blockchain's features of security, decentralization, and transparency. In this paper, we will present the current situation of IoT and blockchain technology and how blockchain technology will strength Internet of Things in various aspects.
